      <p>
        From 1998 to 2007, Bongbong served as Governor of Ilocos Norte where he served for three consecutive terms. During his tenure, he transformed Ilocos Norte into a first-class province of international acclaim, showcasing its natural and cultural destination areas. It was also during his stewardship that Ilocos Norte became a pioneer in wind power technology which, to this day, serves as an alternative source of energy not only for the needs of his province, but for the other parts of northern Luzon as well.

        In 2007, Bongbong was again elected to Congress, where he was appointed Deputy Minority Leader of the House of Representatives. During this term, one of the important pieces of legislation he authored was the Philippine Archipelagic Baselines Law (Republic Act No. 9522).</p>

          <p>Duterte-Carpio was elected mayor of Davao City in 2010. On July 1, 2011, Duterte-Carpio gained national attention when she punched Abe Andres, a Davao City Regional Trial Court sheriff, over the demolition of shanties in Barangay Kapitan Tomas Monteverde Sr., Agdao, Davao City. She had earlier asked the court and the demolition team to delay the demolition but Andres refused, making her furious. On July 11, Sheriffs Confederation of the Philippines Inc. filed a complaint against Duterte-Carpio in connection to the incident. On June 28, 2012, almost a year after the incident, she publicly apologized to Andres and his family.Duterte-Carpio was also one of the nine elected governors of the Philippine Red Cross in 2014.</p>

          <h1 style="text-align:center;">Kiko Pangilinan Accomplishment</h1>
          <p>He went to the Harvard University John F. Kennedy School of Government and in 1998 earned a Master’s Degree in Public Administration as an Edward S. Mason Fellow. Believing that the Philippine judicial system must be able to defend the most vulnerable, he authored and pushed for the passage of the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act which kept children in conflict with the law out of jails intended and designed for adults. Aside from him being blamed for the inadequate implementation of the law, he is also attacked for his defense of children neglected by family, trapped by poverty, and exploited by gangs. His detractors are shut up by his “Hulihin ang sindikatong ginagamit ang mga bata para gumawa ng krimen (Arrest the syndicates exploiting children to commit crimes)” answer. In his second term in senator, he shepherded into law the UP Charter, which provides institutional autonomy by protecting students, ensuring democratic access, and upholding academic freedom. From 2016 to 2019, in the 17th Congress, Kiko filed at least 24 measures ranging from those that give flesh to constitutional provisions (like the Anti-Political Dynasty Act), to those that seek to prevent police brutality as the war on drug claims tens of thousands of lives (like the Body Camera Act and Mandatory Autopsy Law), to pet programs with strategic food security goals (Zero Food Waste Act and Expanded Crop Insurance Act).</p>
