      <p>
        FOUR major political parties have merged to support presidential aspirant Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. and his running mate, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio.The BBM-SARA UniTeam led the signing of the memorandum of agreement (MoA) between the Partido Federal ng Pilipinas (PFP), Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats (CMD), Hugpong ng Pagbabago (HNP) and Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino (PMP) at the Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila in Pasay City on Thursday.In his speech, Marcos said the merging of the four parties signifies unity that would heal and bring peace to a country that dirty politics has long polarized.\"We have come together on the basis of unity. And it is these unifying forces that I believe will bring the stability back first to the political arena, and secondly, to the country," he said.Duterte-Carpio thanked the parties for coming together to support the UniTeam and asked them to "invite more parties to join the alliance.""This alliance does not only show our firm aspirations for our country. It also echoes loudly of our triumph to peacefully unite and stand side by side in the pursuit of continued development and positive change for our fellow Filipinos and the Philippines," Duterte-Carpio, chairman of Lakas-CMD and HNP, said."As your vice presidential candidate, I am proud of this agreement that powerfully illustrates leadership transcending throughout political colors.

        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Support Leni-Kiko tandem</h1>
        <p> from at least 45 cities in the country.
          Volunteer groups like "Lawyers for Leni," "Riders for Leni," "Bikers for Leni," the opposition coalition 1Sambayan, the People Power Volunteers for Reform (PPVR) and Leni Urban Poor were among those who joined the motorcade in Metro Manila that started at 10 a.m. and ended at noon.
          Some cities outside Metro Manila provided drama, such as the fluvial parade in Cebu, a tricycle line in Zambales and an assembly of 300 vehicles in Robredo's home province in Camarines Sur — all adorned in pink.
          Pets were no exception as their owners in Batangas dressed them in pink accessories.
          In Olongapo City, for example, where Robredo got the lowest number of votes when she ran for vice president in 2016, followers of former senator Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. shouted "Marcos pa rin (We're still for Marcos) as the motorcade passed by.
          They replied, "Never again, never forget," referring to the 20-year rule of Marcos' father and namesake, the late president Marcos, who was ousted in a peaceful revolution in 1986.
          Robredo's supporters also experienced the heat, dust and rain, aside from a bad signal as the campaign was run via the internet.
          They avoided gatherings in line with the government's health and safety protocols brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.
          Bam to Leni supporters: Fight fake news, lies
          Singer-host Leah Navarro and Ben Bernabe of Team Leni Robredo (TLR) hosted the event under the supervision of the Leni for President Movement, a multinational coalition that believes in the good governance and vision of Robredo.
          In their short messages, Robredo and Pangilinan expressed their gratitude as they were overwhelmed by the support.
          Speaking in Filipino, Pangilinan encouraged their followers to go out and not be afraid because "if fear can spread, so can courage."
          Also speaking in Filipino, Robrodo reiterated her mantra of how "easy it is to argue, but it is more radical to love."
          In a Publicus Asia survey from October 11 to 18, Marcos was the preferred candidate by 49.3 percent of the respondents. Robredo came in second with 21 percent in a pool of six presidential aspirants.
          On the five vice presidential candidates, Pangilinan ranked fifth with 12.3 percent. Sen. Christopher Lawrence "Bong" Go is the preferred bet with 23.6 percent.
          Social media campaign
          Also on Saturday, other supporters of Robredo launched a social media campaign called #KamiSiLeni with a mission of "unity in diversity," according to its official website.
          "We do recognize that many groups have their own campaign slogans, hashtags and designs as their way of supporting Leni," the description wrote. 
          "Our hope and prayer is that the various campaigns for Leni will also use this #KamiSiLeni and #TayoNaKayLeni in parallel to their own campaign to help tie-in themselves with the other groups and organizations."</p>
